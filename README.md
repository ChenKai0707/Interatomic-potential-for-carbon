Machine learning interatomic potential of carbon

These files are data files for the paper titled "Exploring Phase Change and Structure of Carbon Using Deep Learning Interatomic Potential". The file "compress_model.pb" is the potential function file for carbon. "input.json" contains the parameter settings for training the potential function. "C60-bcc.lammps" is the initial structure used in Figure 9 of the paper, and "md.in" is the parameter file for LAMMPS in Figure 9. Furthermore, the potential function training was carried out utilizing the DeepMD Kit, specifically version 2.0.1.
